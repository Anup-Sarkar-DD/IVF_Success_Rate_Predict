steps performed: 
<p> 
Collected, cleaned, and preprocessed fertility treatment data to build a predictive model for pregnancy success post-IVF.

Handled missing and placeholder values (999) with forward-fill strategy and appropriate data type conversion.

Engineered new features such as age bins and encoded categorical IVF treatment factors for modeling.

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using seaborn and matplotlib to uncover patterns and correlations.

Performed class imbalance handling using RandomOverSampler to improve model performance.

Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler and conducted feature selection with Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) from mlxtend.

Trained and validated a Random Forest Classifier, achieving model evaluation using accuracy scores and prediction metrics.

Visualized feature importance and model selection steps to aid in explainability.

Explored hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV (commented out but shows awareness of advanced model optimization).</p?
