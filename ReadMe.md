<H1>IVF_Success_Rate_Prediction</H1>
<p>This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of successful In 
Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) using historical patient and clinical data. The goal is to identifying key factors influencing IVF 
outcomes. Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest is used to predict IVF Success</p>
