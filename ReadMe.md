<H1>IVF_Success_Rate_Prediction</H1>
<p>This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of success In-
Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) using historical patient and clinical data. The goal is to identifying key factors influencing IVF 
outcomes. Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest is used to predict IVF Success</p>

1. Cleaned and preprocessed a healthcare dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and data type inconsistencies.
2. Dropped low-frequency and ambiguous categorical features based on exploratory data analysis and domain logic.
3. Replaced placeholder values (999) with `NaN` and applied forward fill to impute missing data accurately.
4. Performed feature selection by analyzing value distributions and eliminating non-contributing variables.
5. Automated the data cleaning workflow using pandas chaining techniques for efficiency and reproducibility.
6. Visualized data distributions using seaborn and matplotlib to guide feature retention and removal decisions.
7. Standardized all numerical features to integer format to ensure compatibility with downstream ML models.
8. Validated data integrity and structure post-cleaning using `info()`, `head()`, and shape checks.
9. Prepared the dataset for classification by ensuring a clean, structured, and balanced input feature space.
10. Collaborated across roles to integrate data engineering, analysis, and domain-driven feature refinement.
