<p>Developed a Random Forest classifier using Scikit-learn to predict IVF pregnancy success from 12 clinical 
factors, achieving 65% accuracy after hyperparameter tuning and class imbalance handling. 
• Processed raw medical data by handling missing values with median imputation, merging target classes into 
binary outcomes, and removing correlated features to improve model performance.   
• Transformed categorical variables like infertility type and treatment methods using one-hot encoding in 
Pandas to prepare data for machine learning algorithms.   
• Conducted exploratory data analysis with correlation heatmaps and histograms to identify key relationships 
between clinical factors and pregnancy outcomes.   
• Mapped complex clinical IVF parameters to machine learning features 
• Built a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline from data cleaning to model deployment. 
• Tools & Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn. </p>
